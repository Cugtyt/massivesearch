Massive Search: LLM Structured Outputs is All You Need
=================

![](docs/overview.jpg)

For complex search task like searching both images, text, boolean, and numbers,
these is no simple query language that can express the search.

Massive Search is a way to search for complex data using LLM Structured Outputs.
Here is an example of book searching:

1. Book data, full data in [examples/book/books.csv](examples/book/books.csv):

``` csv
title,description,author,price
"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs","A fairy tale about a princess and seven dwarfs.","Grimm Brothers",10.99
"The Little Prince","A story about a young prince who travels to different planets.","Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry",12.99
...
```

2. Define the search spec, example in [examples/book/book_spec.yaml](examples/book/book_spec.yaml):

``` yaml
indexs:
  - name: title
    type: text_index
    ...
    search_engine:
      type: book_text_search
      ...
  - name: description
    type: text_index
    ...
    search_engine:
      type: book_text_search
      ...
  - name: price
    type: number_index
    ...
    search_engine:
      type: book_price_search
      ...
aggregator:
  type: book_aggregator
  ...
ai_client:
  type: azure_openai
  ...
```

3. Use SpecBuilder to register related index, search engine, and aggregator, example in [examples/book/main.py](examples/book/main.py):

``` python
book_builder = SpecBuilder()

book_builder.register_index("text_index", BasicTextIndex)
book_builder.register_index("number_index", BasicNumberIndex)
book_builder.register_search_engine("book_text_search", PandasTextSearchEngine)
book_builder.register_search_engine("book_price_search", PandasNumberSearchEngine)

book_builder.register_aggregator_type("book_aggregator", PandasAggregator)
book_builder.register_ai_client_type("azure_openai", AzureOpenAIClient)
```

4. Load data, ai model and use Worker to search, example in [examples/book/main.py](examples/book/main.py):

``` python
with Path("./examples/book/book_spec.yaml").open() as file:
    spec_file = yaml.safe_load(file)

book_builder.include(spec_file)
worker = Worker(book_builder.spec)
agg_result = worker.execute(
    "I want to buy a book about prince or lord, I only have 30 dollars.",
)
```

5. Check the result, example in [examples/book/main.py](examples/book/main.py):

``` python
print("Search query:")
for result in worker.last_search_query:
    print(result)

print("Books:")
print(agg_result)
```

The queries is a list of dictionaries, each dictionary is a search query for each index.
The relationship between the queries is OR, results from each query will be merged together.
The relationship between the dictionary indexs is AND, all indexs must be satisfied.
